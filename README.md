# Project Overview

In this a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. All the functionality has been tested using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io)


## How to run the application

1. Download or clone the application from the [repository](https://github.com/angelabadgomez/Feed-Reader-Testing).
2. Uncompress the file if it was downloaded as zip.
3. In your browser open the file index.html from the uncompressed folder.
4. The browser will load the feeds to complete different tests.
5. At the end of the tests you should see (by default) a "7 specs, 0 failures" message.


## Making changes

1. You can add more feeds by providing new entries to the `allFeeds` variable in the _js/app.js_ file.
2. If you need to add or change some tests you can do it in the _jasmine/spec/feedreader.js_ file.
3. If there is a timeout fail, the `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_INTERVAL` value can be adjusted in the _jasmine/spec/feedreader.js_ file.
